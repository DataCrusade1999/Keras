# Keras
Keras is an open-source library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.

Up until version 2.3 Keras supported multiple backends, including TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, and PlaidML.Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible. It was developed as part of the research effort of project ONEIROS (Open-ended Neuro-Electronic Intelligent Robot Operating System),and its primary author and maintainer is Fran√ßois Chollet, a Google engineer. Chollet also is the author of the XCeption deep neural network model.
